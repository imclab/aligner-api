aligner-api
===========

Summary
-------

This is a RESTful API for monolingual text alignment.


*NOTE:* This project is out-of-date. I have not yet separated the alignment functionality out of my 
[entailment-api](https://github.com/gavinmh/entailment-api). Ultimately, alignment functionality will be removed from
that project, and it will consume this API instead. However, I have not completed that work yet, and at the moment, the
alignment functionality is more developed in the entailment-api.
